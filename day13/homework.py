# 1) Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# 2) Write a program that prints the even numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# 3) Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints whether the number is positive, 
#       negative, or zero using an if-else statement.
# 4) Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "abc123", print "Access granted";
#        otherwise, print "Access denied".
# 5) Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but stops if the number is 5 using a while loop and the break statement. break
# 6) Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 5. If the number is less than 1 or greater than 5, print "Invalid input". 
#       If the number is between 1 and 5, print "Valid input".
# 7) Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". 
#       If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 
#       "FizzBuzz". Otherwise, print the number itself.
